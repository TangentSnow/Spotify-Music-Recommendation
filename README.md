# Spotify-Music-Recommendation
This is a personalized music recommendation system built using the Spotify API and Spotipy.<br />
Given a song name, the algorithm recommends five similar tracks based on the original selection.<br />
The program leverages Spotify's music analysis features to evaluate key attributes like tempo, danceability, energy, and more, providing tailored recommendations that closely align with the selected song's profile.

**Setup Instructions:**<br />
Create a `.env` file in the project directory.<br />
Add your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` for Spotify API access.<br />
Once configured, this program will run smoothly, delivering dynamic music recommendations using real-time Spotify data.<br />
